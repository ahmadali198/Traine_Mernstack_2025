üíæ Web Storages, Authentication, & Redis Basics üöÄ
This document provides a concise overview of different web storage mechanisms, a comparison of session and JWT authentication, and a brief introduction to Redis.

üåê Web Storages
Web browsers offer several ways to store data on the client-side.

1. Local Storage
Purpose: Stores data with no expiration date. The data persists even after the browser window is closed and reopened.

Capacity: Typically 5-10 MB.

Accessibility: Accessible via JavaScript on the same origin.

Use Cases: Storing user preferences, theme settings, offline data for single-page applications.

2. Session Storage
Purpose: Stores data for the duration of a single browser session. Data is cleared when the browser tab or window is closed.

Capacity: Similar to Local Storage (5-10 MB).

Accessibility: Accessible via JavaScript on the same origin.

Use Cases: Storing temporary session-specific data, form data across pages.

3. Cookies
Purpose: Small pieces of data stored by the browser, primarily used for tracking user sessions, personalization, and remembering user preferences.

Capacity: Very small (around 4 KB per cookie).

Expiration: Can have an expiration date (persistent) or expire when the browser closes (session cookies).

Accessibility: Sent with every HTTP request to the server, making them suitable for server-side session management. Can also be accessed by JavaScript unless HttpOnly flag is set.

Use Cases: Session management, tracking, personalization.

üö´ Why Not to Use Local Storage (or Session Storage) for Sensitive Data
While convenient, Local Storage and Session Storage are not secure for storing sensitive information like authentication tokens (e.g., JWTs) or user credentials.

Vulnerability to XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) Attacks: If your website is vulnerable to an XSS attack, malicious JavaScript injected into your page can easily access all data stored in Local Storage or Session Storage. This means an attacker could steal a user's token and impersonate them.

No Built-in Security Features: They lack built-in security features like HttpOnly (which prevents JavaScript access to cookies) or Secure (which ensures cookies are only sent over HTTPS).

Not Sent Automatically with Requests: Unlike cookies, data in Local/Session Storage isn't automatically sent with every HTTP request, requiring manual inclusion in headers, which can be error-prone.

For sensitive data, especially authentication tokens, HTTP-only cookies are generally preferred because they are not accessible via client-side JavaScript, significantly reducing the risk of XSS attacks.

üîë Authentication Methods: Session vs. JWT
Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity. Two common methods are session-based authentication and token-based authentication (like JWT).

1. Session Authentication
How it Works:

User logs in with credentials.

Server creates a session (a record of the user's logged-in state) and stores it on the server (e.g., in memory, database, or Redis).

Server generates a unique session ID and sends it to the client, typically as an HttpOnly cookie.

For subsequent requests, the client sends the session ID (cookie) back to the server.

Server uses the session ID to look up the session data and authenticate the user.

Statefulness: Stateful ‚Äì the server needs to store and manage session data for each active user.

2. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication
How it Works:

User logs in with credentials.

Server authenticates the user and generates a JWT.

The JWT is a self-contained, digitally signed token containing user information (payload).

Server sends the JWT to the client (e.g., in the response body).

Client stores the JWT (e.g., in an HttpOnly cookie or in memory if XSS risk is mitigated for short-lived tokens).

For subsequent requests, the client sends the JWT (usually in the Authorization header as a "Bearer" token) to the server.

Server verifies the JWT's signature and expiration. If valid, the user is authenticated without needing to query a database.

Statefulness: Stateless ‚Äì the server doesn't need to store session data. All necessary information is within the token itself.

‚ö° Redis Crash Course
Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It's known for its blazing fast performance.

Key Features
In-Memory: Primarily stores data in RAM, leading to extremely fast read/write operations.

Persistence (Optional): Can persist data to disk for durability, though it's often used as a volatile cache.

Data Structures: Supports various data structures beyond simple key-value pairs, including:

Strings: Basic key-value pairs.

Lists: Ordered collections of strings.

Sets: Unordered collections of unique strings.

Hashes: Maps between string fields and string values (like objects).

Sorted Sets: Sets where each member has a score, allowing for ordering.

Single-Threaded: Processes commands one at a time, ensuring atomicity for operations.

Pub/Sub: Supports publish/subscribe messaging patterns.

Common Use Cases
Caching: The most common use case, speeding up data retrieval by storing frequently accessed data.

Session Management: Storing user session data (especially for distributed applications).

Real-time Analytics: Leaderboards, counting unique visitors.

Message Queues: Implementing simple message brokers.

Rate Limiting: Tracking request counts for API limits.

Brief Concepts & Commands
Redis interacts via a simple command-line interface or client libraries in various programming languages.

Key-Value Store: At its core, Redis is a key-value store.

SET mykey "Hello": Sets a string value.

GET mykey: Retrieves a string value.

EXPIRE mykey 60: Sets an expiration of 60 seconds for mykey.

Working with Hashes (like objects):

HSET user:1 name "Alice" age 30: Sets multiple fields in a hash.

HGET user:1 name: Gets a single field from a hash.

HGETALL user:1: Gets all fields and values from a hash.

Working with Lists (like arrays/queues):

LPUSH mylist "item1" "item2": Adds items to the left (head) of a list.

RPUSH mylist "item3": Adds items to the right (tail) of a list.

LRANGE mylist 0 -1: Gets all items from a list.

LPOP mylist: Removes and returns the leftmost item (useful for queues).
