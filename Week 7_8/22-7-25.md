📚 Node.js Lecture Topics: A Brief Overview 📚
This document provides a concise summary of essential topics typically covered in Node.js lectures, from foundational concepts to more advanced deployment considerations.

🚀 Introduction to Node.js
What is Node.js?

A JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine.

Allows JavaScript to run server-side (outside the browser).

Ideal for scalable network applications and real-time systems.

Key Characteristics:

Asynchronous & Event-Driven: Non-blocking I/O model.

Single-Threaded: Uses an event loop to handle concurrency.

Fast: Thanks to the V8 engine.

🔄 The Node.js Event Loop
Core Concept: Node.js handles operations by pushing tasks to an event queue.

Non-Blocking I/O: When an I/O operation (like reading a file or making a network request) starts, Node.js doesn't wait; it continues processing other tasks.

Callbacks: Once an I/O operation completes, a registered callback function is executed.

Phases: The event loop operates in phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, close callbacks).

📦 Modules in Node.js
Purpose: Organize code into reusable units, prevent naming conflicts.

CommonJS: The default module system in Node.js (require() and module.exports).

require('module_name'): Imports a module.

module.exports = ...: Exports values from a module.

Built-in Modules: Modules provided by Node.js (e.g., http, fs, path).

Third-party Modules: Installed via npm.

🌐 npm (Node Package Manager)
What it is: The default package manager for Node.js.

Functionality:

Install Packages: npm install <package_name>

Manage Dependencies: Listed in package.json.

Run Scripts: Defined in package.json.

Publish Packages: Share your own modules.

⚡ Asynchronous JavaScript in Node.js
Callbacks: Functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed after an operation completes. (Can lead to "callback hell").

Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation.

new Promise((resolve, reject) => { ... })

.then() for success, .catch() for errors.

Async/Await: Syntactic sugar built on Promises, making asynchronous code look and behave more like synchronous code.

async function myFunction() { ... }

await somePromise(): Pauses execution until the promise settles.

📁 File System (fs Module)
Purpose: Interact with the computer's file system.

Common Operations:

Reading Files: fs.readFile(), fs.readFileSync()

Writing Files: fs.writeFile(), fs.writeFileSync()

Deleting Files: fs.unlink()

Checking File Existence: fs.existsSync()

Renaming Files: fs.rename()

Asynchronous vs. Synchronous: Most fs methods have both async (callback-based) and sync (blocking) versions. Prefer async for performance.

🖥️ HTTP Module
Purpose: Build web servers and make HTTP requests.

http.createServer(): Creates an HTTP server instance.

Request & Response Objects:

req (request): Contains client request details (URL, headers, method).

res (response): Used to send data back to the client (status code, headers, body).

Routing (Basic): Handling different URLs and HTTP methods.

🛣️ Introduction to Express.js
What it is: A popular, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

Simplifies Web Development: Provides tools for:

Routing: Defining application endpoints.

Middleware: Functions that have access to the request and response objects, and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle.

Templating: Integrating view engines for dynamic content.

Installation: npm install express

🚨 Error Handling in Node.js
Importance: Crucial for building robust and reliable applications.

Techniques:

Callbacks: Error-first callbacks ((err, data) => {}).

Promises: .catch() blocks.

Async/Await: try...catch blocks.

Event Emitters: error events.

Global Handlers: process.on('uncaughtException'), process.on('unhandledRejection') (use with caution).

🐞 Debugging Node.js Applications
Tools:

console.log(): Simple logging for quick checks.

Node.js Inspector: Built-in debugger, accessible via Chrome DevTools.

VS Code Debugger: Excellent integration for breakpoints, step-through execution, etc.

🗄️ Databases with Node.js
Connecting to Databases: Using npm packages (drivers/ORMs/ODMs).

Relational Databases (SQL):

Drivers: mysql2, pg (for PostgreSQL).

ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers): Sequelize, TypeORM (map database tables to JavaScript objects).

Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):

MongoDB: Mongoose (ODM - Object-Document Mapper).

Redis: ioredis.

🔐 Authentication & Authorization
Authentication: Verifying user identity (who are you?).

Strategies: Local (username/password), OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

Libraries: Passport.js.

Authorization: Determining user permissions (what can you do?).

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

Middleware: Protecting routes based on user roles.

🧪 Testing Node.js Applications
Importance: Ensure code quality, prevent regressions.

Types of Tests:

Unit Tests: Test individual functions or modules in isolation.

Integration Tests: Test interactions between different modules or services.

End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Simulate user scenarios across the entire application.

Testing Frameworks: Jest, Mocha, Chai.

Assertion Libraries: Chai (often used with Mocha).

🚀 Deployment of Node.js Applications
Environment Variables: Managing configuration for different environments (development, production).

Process Managers: PM2 (keep applications running, manage clusters).

Hosting Platforms:

PaaS (Platform as a Service): Heroku, Render.

IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, DigitalOcean Droplets.

Serverless: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions.

Containerization: Docker (packaging applications and dependencies).

📡 WebSockets (Real-time Communication)
Purpose: Enable full-duplex, persistent communication channels between client and server.

Use Cases: Chat applications, live dashboards, online gaming.

Libraries: Socket.IO (popular abstraction over WebSockets).
